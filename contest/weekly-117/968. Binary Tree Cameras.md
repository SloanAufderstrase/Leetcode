Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

 

Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png)

Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)

Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

Note:

The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
Every node has value 0.

Solution:

1. 贪心算法
If we set a camera at the leaf, the camera can cover the leaf and its parent.
If we set a camera at its parent, the camera can cover the leaf, its parent and its sibling.

We can see that the second plan is always better than the first.
Now we have only one option, set up camera to all leaves' parent.

Here is our greedy solution:

1.Set cameras on all leaves' parents, then remove all covered nodes.
2.Repeat step 1 until all nodes are covered.

Return 0 if it's a leaf.
Return 1 if it's a parent of a leaf, with a camera on this node.
Return 2 if it's coverd, without a camera on this node.

用返回值0,1,2表示三种不同的状态
0表示叶子节点
1表示它是叶子节点的父节点，该节点上有一个摄像机
2表示它被cover了，但该节点上没有摄像机（空节点，也会被覆盖了）

解法特别的巧妙

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
	int res = 0;
    public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
        return (dfs(root) < 1 ? 1 : 0) + res; // 若 dfs(root)=1 说明该根节点成为了新的叶子节点，那么放置一个camera
    }

    public int dfs(TreeNode root) {
    	int left = root.left == null ? 2 : dfs(root.left);
    	int right = root.right == null ? 2 : dfs(root.right);

    	if (left == 0 || right == 0) {
    		res++;
    		return 1;
    	}

    	return left == 1 || right == 1 ? 2 : 0; // 要么是叶节点，要么是被cover的节点
    }
}
```
