Description:
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
A partially filled sudoku which is valid.
The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.
Example1:
```
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
```
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being 
    modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

Note:
 - A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
 - Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 - The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
 - The given board size is always 9x9.    

Solution:

这道题的解法很巧妙，构造3个数组，分别来存储行，列，九宫格中是否有不合法的数字出现
出现过的数字置位true，遍历的过程中，若有重复出现的，则直接返回false
需要对九宫格进行特殊的处理，行对3取余后乘以三加上列对3取余的索引，即为九宫格转换为行的方式

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        int n = 9;
        boolean[][] rowMap = new boolean[n][n];
        boolean[][] colMap = new boolean[n][n];
        boolean[][] boardMap = new boolean[n][n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') {
                    continue;
                }
                int index = board[i][j] - '0' - 1;

                if (rowMap[index][j] == true) {
                    return false;
                }
                rowMap[index] = true;

                if (colMap[i][index] == true) {
                    return false;
                }
                colMap[i][index] = true;

                if (boardMap[i/3*3+j/3][index] == true) {
                    return false;
                }
                boardMap[i/3*3+j/3][index] = true;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
